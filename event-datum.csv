d93c1629c354a4bf39392d04ae7cc8a1e46a7945538b14e599b07a8a7d3a5ed0,"the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare's work in the theatre is playwright Robert Greene's attack in Groats-Worth of Wit \n\n    ... there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tiger's heart wrapped in a Player's hide, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute Johannes factotum, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country\n\nMost scholars agree that Greene was accusing Shakespeare of reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Nashe, and Greene himself (the so-called ""University Wits""). The italicised phrase parodying the line ""Oh, tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide"" from Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3, along with the pun ""Shake-scene"", clearly identify Shakespeare as Greene's target. As used here, Johannes Factotum (""Jack of all trades"") refers to a second-rate tinkerer with the work of others."
